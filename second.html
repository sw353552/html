	<article>The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".
	The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts and honey.

	<article>Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.[4] For example, banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake.
	</article><br>
	<article>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.
